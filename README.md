# Types CLI

‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use [Types](https://github.com/khulnasoft/types) instead of [Types CLI](https://github.com/khulnasoft/types-cli).

---

All the functionality in this repo for [`types-cli`](https://github.com/khulnasoft/types-cli), has been integrated into [Types](https://github.com/khulnasoft/types) since version 0.12.1.

The main repo, https://github.com/khulnasoft/types, publishes a PyPI package `types-cli` (that used to be this repo), and that PyPI package does nothing other than depend on `types`.

All the functionality has been integrated into `types`.

Install instead `types`:

```bash
pip install types
```

That includes the `types` command.

This repo is now deprecated and archived. ü§ì
